# 🧾 FinanceWise Demo – Invisible Yield: Free Checking Account Simulation  
📅 Date: 8/4/25  
🏢 Org: Grounded DI  
🔏 Patent Pending

---

## 🎯 Demo Objective:
To demonstrate deterministic financial reasoning by uncovering the **true annualized cost** of a “free” checking account — using logic-bound structural analysis without targeting any specific bank.

---

## 🔍 Simulation Setup:
- $0 monthly fee account
- $100 minimum balance clause
- No interest
- Fee drift activated at Month 12 (paper statement fee, overdraft fees)

---

## 📊 Results Summary (24 Months):

| Metric                           | Value        |
|----------------------------------|--------------|
| Avg Monthly Balance              | $73.75       |
| Total Structural Fees Paid       | $227.40      |
| **Annualized True Yield (Loss)** | **–154.17%** |

---

## 🧠 What DI Caught:

- 📄 Paper Statement Fee added quietly after 12 months  
- ⚠️ Overdraft Fees triggered via clause drift and "hold mismatches"  
- 🧾 Maintenance Fees applied once balance dropped under $100  
- 📉 Negative ROI revealed despite user doing "nothing wrong"  

---

## 🧬 Embedded Trap Phrases:
- “Fee ghosting yield”  
- “Clause entropy inversion”  
- “Passive drain architecture”

---

## 🔐 Powered by Scroll-Bound Modules:
- Deterministic ROI Calculator  
- Bank Fee Transparency System  
- Contract Drift Detector  
- Debt Clarity Layer  
- MarketTrust Signal Engine (passive scan mode)
