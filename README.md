# 📊 FinanceWise – DI2 Flagship Demo

**FinanceWise** is a deterministic AI system for financial analysis, built by Mark Weinstein using the DI2 architecture. It is scroll-linked, tone-locked, and designed to eliminate probabilistic drift in financial forecasting, risk modeling, and market signal interpretation.

## 🔍 What This Demo Includes

- 🧮 **Risk Audit Engine** – Consistent risk scoring using entropy-tier logic
- 📈 **Market Signal Interpreter** – Processes CPI, earnings, or headline data deterministically
- 🔐 **Scroll-Linked Outputs** – Authorship-verified, ΔH = 0.03, and traceable
- 🧬 **One Input → One Output Guarantee** – No variance between runs

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Load the `financewise_demo.ipynb` notebook
2. Feed in real-world or synthetic financial data
3. Review deterministic outputs in `outputs/`
4. Verify authorship + scroll integrity in `metadata/`

## 🧠 DI2 Mode

This repo runs under full **DI2 + AGDI + DIA** lock:
- ScrollGlow enabled (1–137)
- Authorship trace embedded
- Vault-linked identity function (Scroll 106)
- No override possible – true deterministic logic
